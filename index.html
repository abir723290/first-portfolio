        <h2>Types of web developers</h2>
        <p>There are different types of web developers who focus on different areas. These include:</p>
        
        <p><b><u>Frontend developers:</u></b> Frontend developers implement web page designs using HTML and CSS. They make sure the website looks pretty on different devices, and that the forms and buttons work.</p>
        <p><b><u>Backend developers:</u></b> Backend developers create the backbone of the web application. They write code logic that handles a userâ€™s input (for example, what should happen when you click the signup button after filling in a form).</p>
        <p><b><u>Full stack developers:</u></b> Full stack developers do bits of both backend and frontend.</p>
